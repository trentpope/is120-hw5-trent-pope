I used margin on the buttons to give space between the button and the lines of text.
I used padding throughout the card to give space on all four sides of the card-text, the card-btn text, and the price-tag text.
I used display on the card-block which contains all of the cards so that they line up nicely (inline-block). I also used this on the card img and btn for the same reason, since there are multiple text divs that needed to line up correctly.
I used position: relative in the card1 div so that the position: absolute in the price-tag would be stuck in the corner.
